abstract = {Real time fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) is an important area of research interest in knowledge based expert systems. Neurocomputing is one of fastest growing areas of research in the fields of artificial intelligence and pattern recognition. The authors explore the suitability of pattern classification approach of neural networks for fault detection and diagnosis. The suitability of using neural networks as pattern classifiers for power system fault diagnosis is described in detail. A neural network design and simulation environment for real-time FDD is presented. An analysis of the learning, recall and of the neural network diagnostic system is presented and discussed in detail},
